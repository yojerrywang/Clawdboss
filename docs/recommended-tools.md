**Install:** Prompted during setup, or manually:
```bash
npm install -g @apitap/core
```

**Register:**
```bash
mcporter config add apitap --command apitap-mcp --transport stdio

## Python Tools

### Scrapling — Anti-Bot Web Scraping

**What:** High-performance Python web scraping with anti-bot bypass. Adaptive selectors that survive site redesigns. Structured data extraction from JS-rendered and anti-bot-protected pages.

**Install:** Prompted during setup, or manually:
```bash
pip install scrapling
```

**Usage:** Agents use it as a Python library through the `scrapling` OpenClaw skill. No MCP registration needed — the skill handles everything.

## Skills

### GitHub — Issues, PRs, CI/CD

**What:** Full GitHub integration via the `gh` CLI. Create issues, review PRs, search code, check CI runs, and automate DevOps workflows.

**Install:** Prompted during setup, or manually:
```bash
# Install gh CLI (https://cli.github.com)

### Humanizer — AI Writing De-AIification

**What:** Detects and removes signs of AI-generated writing. Scans for 24 AI writing patterns using 500+ vocabulary terms, statistical text analysis (burstiness, perplexity), and applies safe auto-replacements to make text sound natural and human.

**Install:** Prompted during setup, or manually:
```bash
npx clawhub@latest install humanizer
# OR from GitHub:
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/brandonwise/humanizer.git ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/humanizer

### Self-Improving Agent — Continuous Learning

**What:** Captures errors, corrections, and lessons learned to enable continuous improvement. Automatically triggers when commands fail, users correct the agent, a better approach is discovered, or external APIs break. Reviews past learnings before major tasks.

**Install:** Prompted during setup, or manually:
```bash
npx clawhub@latest install self-improving-agent
```

**How it works:**
- Agent detects failures, corrections ("Actually...", "No, that's wrong..."), and outdated knowledge
- Logs learnings to a structured file that persists across sessions
- Reviews relevant learnings before starting new tasks to avoid repeating mistakes

**Links:**
- ClawHub: `self-improving-agent`

### Find Skills — Skill Discovery Helper

**What:** Helps agents discover and install new skills on-the-fly from ClawHub. When you ask "how do I do X?" or "is there a skill for Y?", the agent searches the ClawHub marketplace for matching skills and can install them immediately.

**Install:** Prompted during setup, or manually:
```bash
npx clawhub@latest install find-skills
```

**Links:**
- ClawHub: `find-skills`

[DEFAULT]
bantime  = 1h
findtime = 10m
maxretry = 5

[sshd]
enabled = true
```
