# 🦞 Clawdboss

**Pre-hardened, multi-agent OpenClaw setup by NanoFlow.**

One script to go from zero to a fully secured, multi-agent AI assistant on Discord — with prompt injection defense, security auditing, WAL Protocol for context persistence, and best practices baked in.

## What You Get

- **Multi-agent architecture** — Main agent + optional specialist agents (Comms, Research, Security)
- **Security-first** — Prompt injection defense, anti-loop rules, content tagging, credential isolation
- **WAL Protocol** — Write-Ahead Log for corrections, decisions, and details that survive context loss
- **Working Buffer** — Danger zone logging to survive context compaction without losing work
- **Discord integration** — Bot bound to your server with channel-per-agent routing
- **Env-based secrets** — All API keys in `.env`, never in config files
- **Automated security audits** — Sentinel agent runs scheduled hardening checks
- **OCTAVE protocol** — Structured AI communication with 3-20x token compression (optional)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:NanoFlow-io/clawdboss.git
cd clawdboss

# 2. Install OpenClaw (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash

# 3. Run the setup wizard
./setup.sh
```

The setup wizard will:
1. Prompt for your API keys and Discord credentials
2. Create your `.env` file (gitignored, never committed)
3. Generate `openclaw.json` with `${VAR}` references to your `.env`
4. Create agent workspaces with security rules + WAL Protocol pre-baked
5. Optionally install OCTAVE MCP server for structured document compression
6. Start the gateway

## Configuration Tiers

| Tier | Agents | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Solo** | Main only | Personal assistant, simple setups |
| **Team** | Main + 1-2 specialists | Small business, multiple workflows |
| **Full Squad** | Main + Comms + Research + Security | Full operations center |

## Interface Options

During setup, choose your preferred interface:

| Option | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Discord** | Power users who live in Discord. Channel-per-agent, reactions, threads. |
| **NanoFlow Console** | Visual dashboard with chat, file browser, terminal, cost analytics. Great for non-technical users. |
| **Both** | Use Discord for quick commands + Console for monitoring and file management. |

NanoFlow Console is a branded web dashboard built on [ClawSuite](https://github.com/outsourc-e/clawsuite) (MIT license).

## Context Persistence (WAL Protocol)

Clawdboss agents don't lose your corrections and decisions when context resets:

- **SESSION-STATE.md** — Agent writes important details here BEFORE responding (Write-Ahead Log)
- **Working Buffer** — At ~60% context, every exchange is logged to survive compaction
- **Compaction Recovery** — Agent reads buffer + state files after context loss, never asks "what were we doing?"

See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for the full architecture.

## Security

All API keys are stored in `~/.openclaw/.env` and referenced via `${VAR_NAME}` syntax in the config. Keys never appear in JSON config files.

All agents come with:
- Prompt injection defense (content isolation, pattern detection)
- Anti-loop rules (prevent token-burning attacks)
- External content security (emails, web pages treated as data-only)
- Relentless resourcefulness + VBR (Verify Before Reporting)

See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for the full security architecture.

## Recommended Ecosystem Tools

Clawdboss has been tested with these vetted community tools:

- **[Clawmetry](https://clawmetry.com)** — Real-time observability dashboard. Token costs, sessions, crons, live message flow. `pip install clawmetry && clawmetry` (free, MIT)
- **[ClawSec](https://github.com/prompt-security/clawsec)** — Security suite from Prompt Security. File integrity protection (Soul Guardian), advisory feed monitoring, malicious skill detection. (free, MIT)

See [docs/recommended-tools.md](docs/recommended-tools.md) for install guides.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- A Discord bot token ([create one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- An LLM provider (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Anthropic, or others)
- Optional: Brave Search API key, ElevenLabs API key
