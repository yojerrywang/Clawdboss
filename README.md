## Quick Start

### Ubuntu VPS (Fresh Install)

SSH into your server and run:

```bash
# 1. Clone Clawdboss
apt-get update && apt-get install -y git
git clone https://github.com/NanoFlow-io/clawdboss.git
cd clawdboss

# 2. Run the setup wizard (auto-installs Node.js 22, Python, build tools, OpenClaw)
./setup.sh
```

That's it. The wizard auto-installs all dependencies (Node.js 22, Python, git, build-essential, OpenClaw) and walks you through everything else.

### What You'll Need Ready

- **An LLM provider** — one of:
  - [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) subscription (cheapest — uses copilot-api proxy)
  - [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (sk-...)
  - [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) (sk-ant-...)
- **A Discord bot token** — [create one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (if using Discord interface)
- **A Telegram bot token** — [create one via @BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) (if using Telegram interface)
- **Optional:** Brave Search API key, ElevenLabs API key, OpenAI key for image gen/whisper

The setup wizard will:
1. Ask about **you** — name, role, what you do, how you want to use your agent
2. Ask about **your agent** — name, personality, mission, domain expertise
3. Prompt for your API keys and Discord/Telegram credentials
4. Create your `.env` file (gitignored, never committed)
5. Generate `openclaw.json` with `${VAR}` references to your `.env`
6. Create agent workspaces with security rules + WAL Protocol pre-baked
7. Offer optional tools: Graphthulhu, ApiTap, Scrapling, GitHub, Playwright, OCTAVE, Humanizer, Self-Improving Agent, Find Skills, Marketing Skills, Healthcheck, Clawmetry, ClawSec
8. Run OpenClaw's built-in skills wizard (Whisper, Nano Banana Pro, mcporter, TTS, email, etc.)
9. Start the gateway

Your agent starts its first session knowing who you are, what you do, and what personality it should have — zero manual config file editing needed.

## Configuration Tiers

## Interface Options

During setup, choose your preferred interface:

| Option | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Discord** | Power users who live in Discord. Channel-per-agent, reactions, threads. |
| **Telegram** | Mobile-first. DM your bot or use group topics for multi-agent routing. |
| **ClawSuite Console** | Visual dashboard with chat, file browser, terminal, cost analytics. Great for non-technical users. |
| **Any combination** | Mix and match — Discord + Telegram, Discord + Console, all three, etc. |

ClawSuite Console is an open-source web dashboard — see [ClawSuite on GitHub](https://github.com/outsourc-e/clawsuite) (MIT license).

## Context Persistence (WAL Protocol + 3-Layer Memory)

Clawdboss agents don't lose your corrections and decisions when context resets:

- **3-Layer Memory** — L1 (Brain, loaded every turn) → L2 (Memory, searched semantically) → L3 (Reference, opened on demand)
- **L1 File Budget** — 500-1,000 tokens per workspace file to prevent agents from skimming
- **SESSION-STATE.md** — Agent writes important details here BEFORE responding (Write-Ahead Log)
- **Working Buffer** — At ~60% context, every exchange is logged to survive compaction
- **Compaction Recovery** — Agent reads buffer + state files after context loss, never asks "what were we doing?"
- **Breadcrumbs** — Topic-organized files in `memory/` that point to deep reference docs
- **Trim** — Weekly maintenance to keep L1 files lean, move excess to L2/L3
- **Recalibrate** — Drift correction, forces re-read of all files and behavior comparison

See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for the full architecture.

## Security

All API keys are stored in `~/.openclaw/.env` and referenced via `${VAR_NAME}` syntax in the config. Keys never appear in JSON config files.

All agents come with:
- Prompt injection defense (content isolation, pattern detection)
- Anti-loop rules (prevent token-burning attacks)
- External content security (emails, web pages treated as data-only)
- Relentless resourcefulness + VBR (Verify Before Reporting)

See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for the full security architecture.

## After Install — Getting Your Agent Running

Once the wizard finishes, follow the next steps it shows:

### 1. Start the LLM Provider

**GitHub Copilot (proxy):**
```bash
# First run — shows a device auth URL + code. Open the URL, enter the code,
# authorize with a GitHub account that has an active Copilot subscription ($10/mo).
npx copilot-api start --port 4141

# Run in background (recommended):
tmux new-session -d -s copilot 'npx copilot-api start --port 4141'
```

**OpenAI / Anthropic:** No proxy needed — your API key is already in `.env`.

### 2. Start OpenClaw

```bash
openclaw gateway start
openclaw status       # Verify everything is running
```

### 3. Start ClawSuite Console (if selected)

```bash
cd ~/clawsuite && HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=3000 node server-entry.js

# Run in background:
tmux new-session -d -s console 'cd ~/clawsuite && HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=3000 node server-entry.js'
```

Then open in your browser:
- **Local:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Remote/VPS:** `http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:3000`

### 4. Chat with Your Agent

- **Discord:** Open the channel you configured and send a message
- **ClawSuite Console:** Use the chat panel in the web dashboard
- **Both:** Use either — they connect to the same agent

## Memory System (Hybrid Plugin)

Clawdboss includes a custom **memory-hybrid plugin** that gives your agent two-tier persistent memory:

- **SQLite + FTS5** — Structured facts with full-text search. Instant, zero API cost. Stores entities, preferences, decisions with auto-expiry and confidence decay.
- **LanceDB** — Semantic vector search for fuzzy/contextual recall. Uses OpenAI embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`).

Both backends are queried in parallel, results merged and deduplicated. The agent gets `memory_store`, `memory_recall`, `memory_forget`, `memory_checkpoint`, and `memory_prune` tools automatically.

**Requires:** An OpenAI API key for embeddings (set `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` in your `.env`).

**CLI commands:**
```bash
openclaw hybrid-mem stats           # Show memory statistics
openclaw hybrid-mem search "query"  # Search across both backends
openclaw hybrid-mem prune           # Remove expired memories
```

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04+ (or any Linux with bash)
- Node.js 22+ (setup wizard installs OpenClaw automatically)
- 2GB+ RAM recommended (1GB works for Solo tier)
- A Discord bot token ([create one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)) and/or Telegram bot token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- An LLM provider (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Anthropic, or others)
- Optional: Brave Search API key, ElevenLabs API key
